# Advent of Code 2018 Haskell solutions

I'm building my Haskell solutions using
[cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/). Make sure you're
using an up-to-date version of the tool to get the best `v2-build` support!

```
$ cabal v2-build
```

The project can also be built using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
if that's what you have available.

```
$ stack setup # only necessary the first time you use a resolver
$ stack build
```

## Other languages

I'll be adding C++ and Rust solutions for some of the problems as well.
You can find information about those in the relevant subdirectories.
